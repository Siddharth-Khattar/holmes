## Phase 4.1: Agent Decision Tree Revamp (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Completely revamp the Command Center agent visualization from the current D3-based static node layout to a @xyflow/react + dagre-powered decision tree with rich animations, chosen-path highlighting, smoothstep edges, portal tooltips, and a spring-animated details sidebar — matching the reference implementation from the agent-decision-tree-guide.

**Depends on:** Phase 4

**Requirements:** REQ-VIS-001 (visual quality improvement)

**Plans:** 4 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 04.1-01-PLAN.md — Dependencies, scoped CSS variables, config update, DecisionNode component
- [x] 04.1-02-PLAN.md — NodeDetailsSidebar with spring animation and color-coded sections
- [x] 04.1-03-PLAN.md — ReactFlow canvas with dagre layout, CommandCenter integration, state hooks, layout engine
- [x] 04.1-04 (unplanned refinement) — Muted color palette, FileRoutingEdge, page-level sidebar lift

**Deliverables:** ✓ COMPLETE
- Replace D3 SVG canvas with `@xyflow/react` + dagre auto-layout
- Custom `DecisionNode` with motion entrance/hover animations, muted glow (no text shadow)
- Muted per-agent color palette (~50% saturation reduction, hues preserved for identity)
- Gray neutral edge tiers (processing/chosen/inactive) replacing cyan glow
- Custom `FileRoutingEdge` with click-to-expand file list popup on edges
- `FileGroupNode` intermediate layer between orchestrator and domain agents
- Dagre top-to-bottom hierarchical layout (`rankdir: TB`)
- Portal-rendered tooltip ("Click for more details") via `getBoundingClientRect()`
- `NodeDetailsSidebar` as page-level 30% screen-width panel (not overlay)
- Color-coded sidebar sections with compact badge styling
- Dark canvas background with dot grid via ReactFlow `<Background>`
- Auto-fit viewport with 1.5s smooth animation
- State lifted to page level: `useAgentStates` + `selectedAgent` owned by page
- Extracted `command-center-graph.ts` (node/edge builder) and `command-center-layout.ts` (dagre layout engine)
- `useAgentFlowGraph` hook composing graph building + layout in a single useMemo
- `mock-command-center-data.ts` for demo mode fallback
- All existing SSE integration, types, and hooks preserved

**Technical Notes:**
- Install `@xyflow/react` and `@dagrejs/dagre` as dependencies (no separate @types needed)
- `motion` (v12+) already installed — use for node animations
- Map existing `AgentType` (triage, orchestrator, financial, legal, strategy, knowledge-graph) to decision tree nodes
- Map existing `DEFAULT_CONNECTIONS` to ReactFlow edges
- Chosen path = agent with status `processing` or `complete`; unchosen = `idle`
- Agent pipeline is a fixed tree: triage → orchestrator → [financial, legal, strategy] → knowledge-graph
- Node dimensions: 300px wide, 100px tall, `rounded-lg` (~8px radius)
- Color system: Use existing Holmes design tokens where possible, add accent variables for chosen-path highlighting
- Sidebar replaces current `AgentDetailsPanel` with spring animation and color-coded sections
- Wrap parent page in `<ReactFlowProvider>`
- Import `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css`
- **Reference: `DOCS/UI/agent-decision-tree-guide.md`** — READ THIS FIRST for pixel-level visual spec, data model, component breakdown, color system, animation specs, and layout geometry

**Key files created:**
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/DecisionNode.tsx` — Custom ReactFlow node with motion animations
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/NodeDetailsSidebar.tsx` — Spring-animated sidebar with agent-type sections
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/FileGroupNode.tsx` — Intermediate file group layer node
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/FileRoutingEdge.tsx` — Custom edge with click-to-expand file list popup

- `frontend/src/hooks/useAgentFlowGraph.ts` — Composing graph building + dagre layout
- `frontend/src/lib/command-center-graph.ts` — Node/edge construction from agent states
- `frontend/src/lib/command-center-layout.ts` — Dagre layout engine with progressive visibility
- `frontend/src/lib/mock-command-center-data.ts` — Mock data for demo mode fallback

**Key files modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/AgentFlowCanvas.tsx` — Rewritten with ReactFlow (simplified thin wrapper)
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/CommandCenter.tsx` — Rewritten with ReactFlowProvider, uses extracted hooks
- `frontend/src/lib/command-center-config.ts` — Muted palette, AGENT_TYPE_TINTS, removed manual positions

- `frontend/src/types/command-center.ts` — All types remain
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCommandCenterSSE.ts` — SSE hook remains
- `frontend/src/lib/command-center-validation.ts` — Validation remains

**Dead code (not deleted, superseded):**
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/AgentNode.tsx` — Replaced by DecisionNode
- `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/AgentDetailsPanel.tsx` — Replaced by NodeDetailsSidebar

**Exit Criteria:**
- Agent decision tree renders with hierarchical dagre layout (top-to-bottom)
- Active/chosen agents have accent-colored nodes with glow, floating animation, pulsing border
- Inactive agents are muted dark gray with hover effects
- Smoothstep edges animate along chosen path with glowing trail

  - Batch confirmation modal with per-agent rejection
  - Strategy agent standalone execution with HITL
- **Production hardening** (post-plan)
  - State snapshot refresh resilience (lastResult preservation)
  - Exception handling in domain agent runner for SSE error emission
  - Orchestrator execution committed to DB before domain agent launch
  - JSON thinking trace normalization for Gemini multimodal output
- **Pipeline bugfixes from live testing** (post-plan)
  - compute_agent_tasks covered-pairs tracking for per-file multi-agent routing
  - Strategy gated on orchestrator routing decision
  - Routing decisions flattened to one card per (file, agent) pair
  - Thought parts excluded from JSON parsing

**Technical Notes:**
- All agents receive file content directly (Gemini multimodal)
- Citation format: `{file_id}#{locator}` where locator is page/timestamp/region
- Domain agents run in parallel via asyncio.gather after Orchestrator routing
- Use `media_resolution="high"` for dense document processing
- Video/audio forced through Gemini File API regardless of size
- Audio: request speaker diarization in prompts (best-effort)
- Inline Pro-to-Flash fallback pattern (not separate ResilientAgentWrapper class)
- **DomainAgentRunner** Template Method base class: subclasses override agent_type, output_type, _create_agent
- **extract_structured_json** generic parser: filters thought parts, handles code fences, validates via Pydantic
- **format_thinking_traces**: normalizes JSON-structured thinking (common with multimodal) to readable text
- **compute_agent_tasks** uses covered_pairs set[tuple[str, str]] to track (file_id, agent_type) coverage
- **Per-agent routing HITL**: ROUTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS per agent type, batch confirmation modal
- **Strategy gating**: only runs when explicitly requested by orchestrator (parallel_agents/sequential_agents/routing_decisions)
- **Domain agent prompts include: "Evaluate findings against existing hypotheses"**
- **Key architecture files:**
  - `backend/app/agents/domain_agent_runner.py` — DomainAgentRunner Template Method base class
  - `backend/app/agents/domain_runner.py` — compute_agent_tasks, run_domain_agents_parallel, build_strategy_context
  - `backend/app/agents/parsing.py` — extract_structured_json, extract_response_texts, format_thinking_traces
  - `backend/app/api/agents.py` — Pipeline wiring, strategy gating, routing HITL, SSE emission
  - `backend/app/api/sse.py` — State snapshots, thinking trace normalization, routing decision flattening

**Exit Criteria:** ✓ ALL MET (10/10 + post-plan hardening)
- ✅ All four domain agents process files (migrated to DomainAgentRunner base class)
- ✅ Parallel execution via asyncio.gather with independent DB sessions
- ✅ Thinking traces captured for all agents (JSON normalized for multimodal)
- ✅ Video/audio forced through File API for reliable processing
- ✅ Graceful degradation works (inline Pro-to-Flash fallback)
- ✅ Structured findings with span-level citations output
- ✅ Hypothesis evaluations included in agent output
- ✅ Domain-specific entity taxonomy extracted
- ✅ Outputs aggregated for next phase (build_strategy_context + domain_results dict)
- ✅ HITL confirmation flow verified E2E (agent triggers → modal appears → user responds → agent continues)
- ✅ Per-agent routing HITL with batch confirmation (post-plan)
- ✅ Strategy agent gated on orchestrator routing decision (post-plan)
- ✅ Routing decisions display all target agents per file (post-plan)
- ✅ State snapshot refresh resilience with lastResult preservation (post-plan)

## Phase 7: Knowledge Storage & Domain Agent Enrichment

**Goal:** Create the knowledge storage foundation and enrich domain agent outputs with exhaustive exact-source citations for downstream consumption by KG Builder, Synthesis, and Chat.

**Requirements:** REQ-AGENT-009 (partial — programmatic KG Builder), REQ-STORE-001, REQ-STORE-002, REQ-AGENT-003/004/005/006 (citation enrichment)

**Depends on:** Phase 6 (Domain Agents)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-07) — 6 plans, 11 commits

**Verification:** `.planning/phases/07-knowledge-storage--and--domain-agent-enrichment/07-VERIFICATION.md` — 8/8 must-haves verified

**Plans:** 6 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — DB schema: 9 new tables (KG, findings, synthesis) + Alembic migration + tsvector search
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Pydantic schemas for KG/findings APIs + domain agent findings_text enrichment
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — KG Builder service (entity extraction, relationships, deduplication) + findings service (storage, full-text search)
- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — Domain agent prompt enrichment (exhaustive citations, findings_text instructions)
- [x] 07-05-PLAN.md — API endpoints (KG + findings) + router registration
- [x] 07-06-PLAN.md — SSE events + pipeline wiring (findings storage, KG Builder, entity backfill)

### Frontend Available (Yatharth, 2026-02-02)
- ✅ D3.js Knowledge Graph visualization (to be replaced by vis-network in Phase 7.1)
- ✅ Entity detail panel, legend, zoom/pan controls
- ✅ Evidence source panel (`evidence-source-panel.tsx`)
- ✅ Hooks ready (`use-case-graph.ts`)

### Backend Work
**Deliverables:**
- New database tables + Alembic migrations:
  - `kg_entities` (id, case_id, name, entity_type, domain, metadata JSONB, source_execution_id, source_finding_index, merged_into_id, created_at)
  - `kg_relationships` (id, case_id, source_entity_id, target_entity_id, type, label, strength, source_execution_id, metadata JSONB, created_at)
  - `case_findings` (id, case_id, workflow_id, agent_type, agent_execution_id, file_group_label, category, title, finding_text, confidence, citations JSONB, entity_ids JSONB, created_at)
  - `case_hypotheses` (id, case_id, workflow_id, claim, status, confidence, supporting_evidence JSONB, contradicting_evidence JSONB, source_agent, reasoning, created_at)
  - `case_contradictions` (id, case_id, workflow_id, claim_a, claim_b, source_a JSONB, source_b JSONB, severity, domain, resolution_status, created_at)
  - `case_gaps` (id, case_id, workflow_id, description, what_is_missing, why_needed, priority, related_entity_ids JSONB, suggested_actions, created_at)
  - `case_synthesis` (id, case_id, workflow_id, case_summary, case_verdict JSONB, cross_modal_links JSONB, cross_domain_conclusions JSONB, key_findings_summary, risk_assessment, timeline_event_count, created_at)
  - `timeline_events` (id, case_id, workflow_id, title, description, event_date, event_end_date, event_type, layer, source_entity_ids JSONB, citations JSONB, created_at)
  - `locations` (id, case_id, workflow_id, name, coordinates JSONB, location_type, source_entity_ids JSONB, temporal_associations JSONB, created_at) — populated later by Geospatial Agent (Phase 8.1)
- Domain agent prompt enrichment:
  - Exhaustive span-level citations for EVERY statement (exact excerpts, page numbers, timestamps)
  - Rich markdown `findings_text` field: detailed analysis paragraphs per finding with inline source references
  - Instruction reinforcement: "Every factual claim must reference the exact source excerpt"
- Domain agent output schema enhancements:
  - Add `findings_text: str` field (markdown format, extensive analysis with inline citations)
  - Ensure `Citation` model captures exact excerpts and page/timestamp locators
- Programmatic KG Builder service (Python, NOT an LLM agent):
  - Reads domain agent structured output (`agent_executions.output_data`)
  - Extracts ALL entities from `DomainEntity` lists across all domain agents
  - Creates relationship edges (entity A mentioned with entity B in same finding)
  - Entity deduplication: exact name+type match → auto-merge; fuzzy >85% → flag for LLM resolution in Phase 8
  - Degree computation (connection counts for node sizing)
  - Additive-only: NEVER filters or discards entities/relationships
- case_findings storage service:
  - Saves each finding to `case_findings` table after domain agent completes
  - Links to agent_execution via agent_execution_id for audit trail
- KG API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/graph` — Full graph data (nodes + edges for frontend)
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/entities` — Entity list with search/filter
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/relationships` — Relationship list
  - `POST /api/cases/:caseId/entities` — Create entity (manual user addition)
  - `PATCH /api/cases/:caseId/entities/:entityId` — Update entity
  - `DELETE /api/cases/:caseId/entities/:entityId` — Delete entity
  - `POST /api/cases/:caseId/relationships` — Create relationship (manual)
- Findings API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/findings` — List findings by agent/category
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/findings/:findingId` — Get finding with full citations
- SSE events:
  - `FINDING_COMMITTED` — Finding saved, available for sidebar display
  - `KG_ENTITY_ADDED` — Entity added to KG
  - `KG_RELATIONSHIP_ADDED` — Relationship added to KG
- Vector store setup (v1 = PG full-text search via tsvector; Vertex AI RAG upgrade path in Phase 9):
  - Raw finding text indexed for semantic/keyword search by Chat Agent
  - Full-text search index on case_findings.finding_text
- Pipeline wiring update in agents.py:
  - After each domain agent completes: save findings → extract entities → build relationships → emit SSE
  - After ALL domain agents complete: run entity deduplication pass
  - SSE events fire as data is committed

**Technical Notes:**
- KG Builder is a Python service (NOT an LLM agent) — reads structured Pydantic output, writes to DB tables
- Entity deduplication: exact name+type match for easy cases (95%+), fuzzy matching for harder cases (Levenshtein distance)
- Domain agents produce dual output: structured entities (for KG) + rich markdown text (for display + vector/full-text search)
- All citation fields must include: file_id, locator (page/timestamp), exact_excerpt, surrounding_context
- case_findings rows link to agent_executions via agent_execution_id for full audit trail
- Pipeline remains: Triage → Orchestrator → Domain Agents (parallel) → [KG Builder + findings storage]
- Vector store is optional for Phase 7 (PG full-text search sufficient); Vertex AI RAG can be added in Phase 9
- **Key architecture files to create:**
  - `backend/app/services/kg_builder.py` — Programmatic KG Builder
  - `backend/app/services/findings_service.py` — case_findings storage
  - `backend/app/models/knowledge_graph.py` — KgEntity, KgRelationship models
  - `backend/app/models/findings.py` — CaseFinding model
  - `backend/app/models/synthesis.py` — Hypothesis, Contradiction, Gap, Synthesis, TimelineEvent models
  - `backend/app/api/knowledge_graph.py` — KG API endpoints
  - `backend/app/api/findings.py` — Findings API endpoints

**Exit Criteria:**
- Domain agents produce enriched findings with exhaustive exact-source citations for every statement
- All findings stored in case_findings table and accessible via API
- All entities and relationships extracted and stored in KG tables
- KG API returns valid graph data for frontend consumption
- SSE events fire for findings + KG updates
- Entity deduplication produces clean, non-redundant entity set
- No entity or relationship from domain agents is lost in the programmatic extraction
- Full-text search operational on case_findings

---

## Phase 7.1: LLM-Based KG Builder Agent

**Goal:** Replace the programmatic KG Builder with an LLM-based agent that reads ALL domain agent outputs holistically and produces a curated knowledge graph with deduplicated high-level entities and semantic relationships — enabling cross-domain connections impossible with per-finding co-occurrence.

**Requirements:** REQ-AGENT-009 (revised — LLM-based, not programmatic)

**Depends on:** Phase 7 (case_findings + raw entities stored, KG API endpoints exist)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-08) — 2 plans, 6 commits, 8/8 must-haves verified

**Verification:** `.planning/phases/07.1-llm-kg-builder-agent/07.1-VERIFICATION.md` — 8/8 must-haves verified

**Plans:** 2 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 07.1-01-PLAN.md — DB schema evolution (Alembic migration, ORM columns) + Pydantic schemas (LLM output + API response)
- [x] 07.1-02-PLAN.md — KG Builder agent (runner, factory, prompt, input assembly, DB write) + pipeline wiring

**Context / Why This Change:**
The Phase 7 programmatic KG Builder produces low-quality graphs because:
1. **Zero entity filtering** — every entity (timestamps, dollar amounts, hardware model numbers) becomes a graph node
2. **Pure co-occurrence relationships** — edges labeled "co-occurrence (Authenticity Analysis)" carry zero semantic signal
3. **Incomplete deduplication** — "$2,000" and "2,000 dollars" stay as separate nodes (fuzzy matches logged but not merged)
4. **No cross-domain connections** — each domain agent operates in isolation; the programmatic builder can't connect financial findings to legal findings

Research (Microsoft GraphRAG, KGGen NeurIPS 2025, LINK-KG, Epstein Doc Explorer) confirms: **LLM-based relationship extraction + LLM-based deduplication** is the state of the art. The programmatic approach is suitable only when structured relationships are already available.

**Deliverables:**
- **KG Builder Agent** (Gemini Pro, `thinking_level="high"`, 1M context window):
  - Input: ALL `case_findings` (rich markdown with citations) + all raw `DomainEntity` lists from `agent_executions.output_data` + case description + file metadata
  - Output (`KGBuilderOutput` Pydantic model):
    - `entities: list[CuratedEntity]` — Deduplicated, high-level investigation entities only
    - `relationships: list[SemanticRelationship]` — Typed semantic relationships with evidence grounding
  - Entity taxonomy (investigation-focused, inspired by LINK-KG + Epstein Doc Explorer):
    - **PERSON** — Named individuals (suspects, witnesses, victims, officers)
    - **ORGANIZATION** — Companies, agencies, groups, shell entities
    - **LOCATION** — Physical places, addresses, jurisdictions
    - **EVENT** — Specific occurrences with dates (transactions, meetings, communications)
    - **ASSET** — Properties, vehicles, investments, digital wallets
    - **FINANCIAL_ENTITY** — Bank accounts, transactions, instruments
    - **COMMUNICATION** — Phone calls, emails, messages, documents exchanged
    - **DOCUMENT** — Key evidence items referenced across findings
  - Timestamps, monetary amounts, physical objects → metadata on entities/relationships, NOT standalone nodes
  - Entity deduplication handled naturally by the LLM seeing all findings together (e.g., "$2,000" and "2,000 dollars" → single entity with aliases)
  - Cross-domain relationship inference: financial agent found wire transfer + legal agent found regulatory violation → LLM connects them
  - Every relationship must include `evidence_excerpt` (exact source text) and `source_finding_ids` for traceability
- **Pydantic output schemas:**
  ```python
  class CuratedEntity(BaseModel):
      name: str                       # Canonical name
      entity_type: str                # PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, EVENT, ASSET, etc.
      aliases: list[str]              # All known aliases/variants found across agents
      description: str                # Brief description synthesized from findings
      domain: str                     # Primary domain (financial/legal/evidence/strategy)
      confidence: float               # 0-100
      source_finding_ids: list[int]   # Traceability to case_findings

  class SemanticRelationship(BaseModel):
      source_entity: str              # Must match an entity name
      target_entity: str              # Must match an entity name
      relationship_type: str          # Semantic: "employed_by", "transferred_funds_to", "owns"
      label: str                      # Human-readable: "CEO of", "Wire transfer to"
      strength: float                 # 0-100
      temporal_context: str | None    # When: "2016-05-02", "Q4 2019", etc.
      evidence_excerpt: str           # Exact source text supporting this relationship
      source_finding_ids: list[int]   # Traceability
  ```
- **Pipeline wiring changes:**
  - Remove programmatic KG Builder calls from pipeline (extract_entities_from_output, build_relationships_from_findings, deduplicate_entities)
  - After ALL domain agents complete + findings saved → invoke KG Builder Agent
  - KG Builder Agent clears old kg_entities/kg_relationships for this workflow → writes curated data
  - Emit SSE events: `KG_BUILDER_STARTED`, `KG_BUILDER_COMPLETE`
  - Raw entities from domain agents still saved in `agent_executions.output_data` for audit trail
- **KG API compatibility:**
  - Existing `GET /api/cases/:caseId/graph` endpoint continues to work (reads from same kg_entities/kg_relationships tables)
  - No frontend API changes needed — curated data replaces noisy data in same tables
  - Entity `aliases` stored in `properties` JSONB column
- **Prompt design:**
  - Instruct: "Extract only investigation-relevant entities. Do NOT create standalone nodes for timestamps, monetary values, or physical objects — these are metadata on events and relationships."
  - Instruct: "Every relationship must have a specific semantic type (not 'co-occurrence'). Use verbs like 'employed_by', 'transferred_funds_to', 'owns', 'met_with', 'signed', 'authorized'."
  - Instruct: "Deduplicate entities across all domain agents. If the financial agent found 'J. Smith' and the legal agent found 'John Smith', merge them into one entity with both as aliases."
  - Instruct: "Identify cross-domain connections. If a wire transfer (financial) relates to a contract violation (legal), create a relationship between them."

**Technical Notes:**
- KG Builder Agent runs in fresh stage-isolated ADK session (consistent with pipeline pattern)
- Input is TEXT from PostgreSQL (case_findings.finding_text + entity lists), NOT multimodal file content
- 1M context window handles even large cases (~100-150K tokens for 50-file case)
- Cost: ~$0.05-0.15 per KG build at Gemini Pro rates (single LLM call)
- The curated KG directly improves Phase 8 Synthesis quality — cleaner entity data → better hypotheses and contradictions
- **Key files to create/modify:**
  - `backend/app/agents/kg_builder/` — KG Builder agent module (agent, prompts, schemas)
  - `backend/app/services/kg_builder.py` — Refactor: replace programmatic logic with LLM agent invocation + result storage
  - `backend/app/schemas/knowledge_graph.py` — Add CuratedEntity, SemanticRelationship, KGBuilderOutput schemas
  - `backend/app/api/agents.py` — Update pipeline: remove programmatic KG calls, add KG Builder Agent invocation

**Exit Criteria:**
- KG Builder Agent produces curated entity list with ~15-30 entities (not 50+ noisy ones) for a typical case
- Relationships have semantic type labels (e.g., "CEO of", "transferred $50K to") not "co-occurrence"
- Entity deduplication works across domain agents (same person found by financial + legal = one entity)
- Cross-domain relationships exist (financial finding connected to legal finding)
- No standalone timestamp/amount/physical-object nodes in the graph
- Every entity has aliases array populated from cross-agent dedup
- Every relationship has evidence_excerpt for traceability
- Existing KG API returns the curated data without changes
- Graph quality comparable to Image 1 (mock) or Epstein Doc Explorer (Image 3) in terms of clarity and semantic meaning

## Phase 7.2: Knowledge Graph Frontend (D3.js Enhancement)

**Goal:** Transform the existing D3.js knowledge graph into a premium investigative visualization with Epstein Doc Explorer-inspired layout, physics, filtering panels (local to KG canvas), multi-media source viewer, and relationship timeline — while adapting to Holmes's Liquid Glass design system.

**Requirements:** REQ-VIS-003 (D3.js approach)

**Depends on:** Phase 7.1 (curated KG data with semantic relationships), Phase 7 (KG API endpoints)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-08) — 5 plans + 28 post-plan polish commits (46 total)

**Verification:** `.planning/phases/07.2-kg-frontend-d3-enhancement/07.2-05-SUMMARY.md` — Full summary with all 29 Plan 05 commits

**Plans:** 5 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 07.2-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: types rewrite, entity color config, force params, API client, data hook
- [x] 07.2-02-PLAN.md — Source viewer: modal shell + PDF/audio/video/image sub-components
- [x] 07.2-03-PLAN.md — D3 graph canvas: GraphSvg, simulation hook (5 forces, D3 refs), selection hook
- [x] 07.2-04-PLAN.md — Panels: FilterPanel (domain/type/search), EntityTimeline sidebar, filter hook
- [x] 07.2-05-PLAN.md — Integration: KnowledgeGraphCanvas orchestrator, page rewrite, fullscreen, + 4 rounds visual polish

**Reference:** `DOCS/reference/epstein-network-ui/` — Epstein Doc Explorer frontend code (layout, physics, interactions). Adapt patterns to Holmes design system and use case.

**Deliverables:**
- **D3.js force simulation enhancement** (improve existing `knowledge-graph.tsx`):
  - D3 force simulation with 5 forces: link, charge, center, collision, radial
  - Radial force: high-connection entities near center, low-connection pushed outward
  - Collision detection using actual circle radius + padding
  - Sqrt-scaled node radius (connection count → 5-100px range)
  - Link distance: constant base (50px) or relationship-type-based
  - Charge repulsion: -400 (tunable)
  - Continuous simulation with tick-based position updates
- **Node rendering and interaction:**
  - SVG circles with domain-colored fills (person=orange, org=green, location=blue — consistent with Holmes palette)
  - Node labels (entity names) below circles
  - Click node → highlight node + all connected edges (white), dim unconnected edges
  - Click same node again → deselect
  - Hover tooltip: entity name, connection count, entity type
  - Drag individual nodes (fix position during drag, release on drop)
  - Zoom/pan with `d3.zoom()` (scale extent [0.01, 10])
- **Left panel — Filters & Controls** (local to KG canvas, NOT in the app-wide sidebar):
  - Positioned on the left side of the knowledge graph canvas area
  - Selected entity display with Clear button
  - Graph stats: entity count, relationship count, domain breakdown
  - Entity search (debounced text input, highlights matching nodes)
  - Keyword filter (comma-separated fuzzy match against relationship labels/entity names)
  - Domain layer toggles (Financial, Legal, Evidence, Strategy) with select/deselect all
  - Document category toggles (with counts) mapped from source file types
  - Density threshold slider (prune low-connection nodes by percentage of average)
- **Right panel — Entity Timeline** (local to KG canvas):
  - Appears when entity is selected
  - Chronological list of relationships involving selected entity
  - Each entry: year/date, relationship description (actor → action → target), source citation reference
  - Filter by related entity name (text input)
  - Source citations act as navigation index for the source viewer (click a citation → jump to excerpt/timestamp)
  - Scrollable timeline with entity names highlighted in accent colors
  - Stays visible when source viewer is open (does not get hidden)
- **Source viewer panel** (replaces simple "document excerpt modal" — details to be refined during phase discussions):
  - Multi-media: renders content based on source type (document text, video player, audio player, image viewer)
  - For documents: full text excerpt with entity names highlighted (selected entity = yellow, related = orange)
  - For audio/video: playback with timestamp navigation from right panel citations
  - For images: viewer with annotation overlay capability
  - Opens alongside (not replacing) the right panel — right panel citations serve as navigable index
  - Source metadata header (summary, category, date range)
  - Close button (X)
  - NOTE: Reusable component beyond KG view (Evidence Library, Timeline, etc.) — full specification during phase discussions
- **Edge rendering:**
  - SVG lines with relationship-type-based opacity
  - Highlight connected edges on node selection (white, full opacity); dim unconnected edges
  - Edge hover tooltip: relationship label, temporal context, source document
  - Edge deduplication: multiple relationships between same entity pair → single edge with count
- **Responsive layout:**
  - Three-panel layout LOCAL to KG canvas: left panel (320px) | center graph | right panel (384px, appears on select) — not in app-wide sidebar
  - Dark canvas background consistent with Holmes theme
  - Bottom instruction bar: "Click nodes to explore relationships · Scroll to zoom · Drag to pan"
  - Fullscreen capability with maximize button
- **Connected to real KG API** from Phase 7 (curated data from Phase 7.1)

**Technical Notes:**
- Enhance existing D3.js implementation — do NOT replace with vis-network
- Use raw D3.js (d3.forceSimulation, d3.zoom, d3.drag) inside React useEffect hooks
- Adapt Epstein Doc Explorer patterns (radial force, density pruning, sidebar layout) to Holmes design system
- Entity timeline right panel inspired by Epstein's relationship timeline (stays visible when source viewer opens)
- Multi-media source viewer inspired by Epstein's document viewer with entity highlighting (extends to audio/video/image)
- Maintain Holmes Liquid Glass aesthetic (cream palette, glass effects, Fraunces typography)
- **Reference code:** `DOCS/reference/epstein-network-ui/` (NetworkGraph.tsx, App.tsx, types, API patterns)
- **Key frontend files created:**
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/KnowledgeGraphCanvas.tsx` — 3-panel orchestrator (CanvasShell + GraphSvg + FilterPanel + SourceViewerModal)
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/GraphSvg.tsx` — D3.js SVG canvas with tooltips, zoom controls, simulation toggle
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/FilterPanel.tsx` — Floating filter panel (domain/type toggles, search, keyword filter)
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/KnowledgeGraphEntityPanel.tsx` — Entity detail for app-wide DetailSidebar
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/EntityTimeline.tsx` — Chronological relationship timeline
  - `frontend/src/components/knowledge-graph/EntityTimelineEntry.tsx` — Expandable timeline entry with evidence excerpt
  - `frontend/src/components/source-viewer/SourceViewerModal.tsx` — Multi-media source viewer shell
  - `frontend/src/components/source-viewer/PdfViewer.tsx` — PDF viewer with page navigation
  - `frontend/src/components/source-viewer/AudioViewer.tsx` — Audio viewer with wavesurfer.js waveform
  - `frontend/src/components/source-viewer/VideoViewer.tsx` — HTML5 video with timestamp markers
  - `frontend/src/components/source-viewer/ImageViewer.tsx` — Zoom/pan image viewer
  - `frontend/src/components/ui/canvas-shell.tsx` — Shared canvas container (used by CC and KG)
  - `frontend/src/components/ui/collapsible-section.tsx` — Shared accordion section
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useGraphSimulation.ts` — D3 force simulation lifecycle (5 forces, D3 refs, zoomToNode)
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useGraphSelection.ts` — Selection + search highlighting (forceSelect for external sync)
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useGraphFilters.ts` — Filter state with disabled-set pattern
  - `frontend/src/hooks/use-case-graph.ts` — Real API data hook (refactored from mock)
  - `frontend/src/lib/api/graph.ts` — KG API client
  - `frontend/src/lib/knowledge-graph-config.ts` — Entity colors, force params, badge styles, alias map
  - `frontend/src/types/knowledge-graph.ts` — Backend-matching types (EntityResponse, RelationshipResponse, ForceNode, ForceLink)
- **Key frontend files modified:**
  - `frontend/src/components/CommandCenter/NodeDetailsSidebar.tsx` — Uses shared getEntityBadgeStyle()
  - `frontend/src/lib/command-center-validation.ts` — Agent key alias map (kg_builder → knowledge-graph)
  - `frontend/src/components/app/detail-sidebar.tsx` — Passes onEntitySelect prop to KG entity panel
  - `frontend/src/types/detail-sidebar.ts` — onEntitySelect in KG entity content type

**Exit Criteria:** ✓ ALL MET (source viewer deferred)
- ✅ KG renders with D3.js force simulation using curated entity/relationship data from API
- ✅ High-connection entities visually closer to center (radial force)
- ✅ Clicking a node highlights it and all connected edges, opens entity detail in app-wide DetailSidebar
- ✅ Entity detail shows chronological relationships, connected entities (click-to-navigate + zoom-to-node)
- ⏳ Source viewer panel: components built (PDF/audio/video/image) but NOT wired — `source_finding_ids → file URL` chain requires backend API. **Deferred to Phase 10 (Source Panel).** Currently shows "Source not yet available" graceful degradation.
- ✅ Filter panel provides filtering by domain, keywords, entity search, entity type toggles
- ✅ Graph tells a clear story: a first-time user can identify key persons, organizations, and their relationships
- ✅ CanvasShell layout with floating filter panel, adapts to screen size
- ✅ Fullscreen mode works
- ✅ Performance: ambient glow on all nodes, smooth zoom, no simulation teardown on sidebar open
- ✅ Node aesthetic matches Command Center: gradient fills, ambient glow, stronger hover glow, borderless by default, white stroke on selection
- ✅ Entity colors unified between CC extracted entities and KG badges via shared getEntityBadgeStyle()

## Phase 7.3: Knowledge Graph Frontend (vis-network) — OPTIONAL

**Goal:** Premium knowledge graph visualization with intelligent clustering, physics-based layout, and relationship-aware spacing — Alternative implementation using vis-network. Preserved for experimentation if D3.js approach (Phase 7.2) proves insufficient for large graphs.

**Requirements:** REQ-VIS-003 (alternative approach)

**Depends on:** Phase 7.1 (curated KG data), Phase 7 (KG API)

**Status:** ⏳ DEFERRED

**Plans:** 5 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [ ] 07.3-01-PLAN.md — Shared domain colors config, API-aligned TypeScript types, KG API client, vis-network install
- [ ] 07.3-02-PLAN.md — Core vis-network rendering: hook, physics config, data transformer, main graph component
- [ ] 07.3-03-PLAN.md — UI chrome: filter panel, search, legend, entity detail sidebar, clustering, page wiring

**Deliverables:**
- Replace D3.js force-directed graph with vis-network (direct integration via `useRef`/`useEffect` for full TypeScript control)
- Group-based entity type clustering with ForceAtlas2-based physics simulation
- Relationship-type-based edge configuration (length, width, color by category)
- Entity detail panel, 5 toggleable layers, search and highlight, fullscreen
- Node scaling by degree, zoom/pan controls
- Lazy clustering for graphs with >200 nodes (vis-network clustering API)

**Technical Notes:**
- vis-network integrated directly via `useRef<HTMLDivElement>` + `useEffect` pattern
- ForceAtlas2Based solver for superior cluster formation
- Dependencies: `vis-network` and `vis-data` npm packages
- Consider only if D3.js approach (Phase 7.2) proves insufficient for >500 node graphs or if Canvas rendering is needed for performance

**Exit Criteria:**
- Same as Phase 7.2 exit criteria, using vis-network instead of D3.js

## Phase 8: Synthesis Agent & Intelligence Layer

**Goal:** Cross-reference all domain findings to generate hypotheses, contradictions, evidence gaps, timeline events, cross-modal/cross-domain conclusions, and case-level summary/verdict. Connect existing frontend components to real data.

**Requirements:** REQ-AGENT-008, REQ-HYPO-001/002/003/004/005/006, REQ-WOW-001/002/003/004, REQ-VIS-004/005/006, REQ-TASK-001/002

**Depends on:** Phase 7.1 (curated KG with semantic relationships), Phase 7 (case_findings + DB tables)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-09)

**Plans:** 7 plans in 3 waves — all complete, plus 3 post-completion bugfix commits

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — DB schema (InvestigationTask model, Case verdict columns, Alembic migration, Pydantic schemas)
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Synthesis Agent (runner, prompt, factory, input assembly, output writer, pipeline Stage 8)
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Backend API endpoints (synthesis, hypotheses, contradictions, gaps, tasks, timeline)
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Frontend types, API client, React Query hooks for synthesis data
- [x] 08-05-PLAN.md — Frontend Verdict card components + VerdictView layout
- [x] 08-06-PLAN.md — Frontend DetailSidebar panels + Command Center tab toggle + SSE wiring
- [x] 08-07-PLAN.md — Frontend Timeline wiring + Case header verdict badge + backend CaseResponse schema

Post-completion fixes:
- [x] Gemini schema compat: replaced `dict[str, str]` with `CrossModalLink` typed model (Gemini rejects `additionalProperties`)
- [x] Pipeline crash: `CaseFile.content_type` → `CaseFile.mime_type`, timeline date string→datetime parsing, Timeline hydration/scroll-position warnings
- [x] Gap entity display: prompt changed from position indices to UUIDs, `RelatedEntity` model with batch resolution in API, entity name + type badge in sidebar; KG agent event routing fixed (`_extract_agent_type` rsplit for multi-word prefixes)

### Frontend Available (Yatharth, 2026-02-02)
- ✅ Timeline view with day/week/month/year zoom, layer filtering, event cards, search (`Timeline/`)
- ✅ Evidence source panel (`evidence-source-panel.tsx`)
- ✅ Timeline SSE hooks ready (`useTimelineSSE.ts`)
- ⏳ Hypothesis view (pending implementation or connection)
- ⏳ Contradictions panel (basic conflict UI in Evidence Library)
- ⏳ Evidence gaps panel (not started)

**Deliverables:**
- Synthesis Agent implementation (LLM, Gemini Pro, `thinking_level="high"`):
  - **Input Assembly (two-source DB read pattern):**
    1. **Domain agent findings** (via `case_findings` table): ALL rows for the case's workflow — each contains `finding_text` (rich markdown with inline citations), `citations` (JSONB with file_id + locator + exact_excerpt), `agent_type` (financial/legal/evidence/strategy), `category`, `confidence`. These are the outputs from all domain agents + strategy agent, saved to DB in pipeline Stage 6 (Save Findings).
    2. **Curated knowledge graph** (via `kg_entities` + `kg_relationships` tables): Entities with `name`, `entity_type`, `description_brief`, `description_detailed`, `aliases`, `domains`, `source_finding_ids` — and relationships with `label`, `relationship_type`, `evidence_excerpt`, `temporal_context`, `source_finding_ids`, `confidence`. These are the curated outputs from the LLM KG Builder Agent (pipeline Stage 7), which reads ALL domain outputs holistically.
    3. **Case metadata**: `cases.name`, `cases.description`, `cases.case_type`
    4. **File metadata**: `case_files.original_filename`, file type, upload date (for cross-referencing citations)
  - Gemini 3 Pro with 1M context window (sufficient: ~100-150K tokens for 50-file cases)
  - Output (SynthesisOutput Pydantic model):
    a. `hypotheses: list[Hypothesis]` — Case hypotheses with initial confidence + supporting/contradicting evidence
    b. `contradictions: list[Contradiction]` — Detected contradictions with exact source pairs, severity (minor/significant/critical)
    c. `gaps: list[EvidenceGap]` — Missing evidence with priority ranking, what's needed, why
    d. `cross_modal_links: list[CrossModalLink]` — Temporal correlations across modalities (video ↔ document, audio ↔ text)
    e. `cross_domain_conclusions: list[CrossDomainConclusion]` — Insights from combining financial + legal + evidence + strategy findings
    f. `timeline_events: list[TimelineEvent]` — Chronological events extracted from findings with date/time, type, layer
    g. `case_summary: str` — Executive summary of the entire case
    h. `case_verdict: CaseVerdict` — Overall assessment with confidence, key strengths, key weaknesses
    i. `risk_assessment: str` — Risk factors and mitigation suggestions
    j. `has_location_data: bool` — Trigger flag for Geospatial Agent (Phase 8.1)
- Store results in dedicated synthesis tables (schema from Phase 7 migrations):
  - case_hypotheses, case_contradictions, case_gaps, case_synthesis, timeline_events
- Pipeline wiring:
  - New Stage 8 in the pipeline, triggered after LLM KG Builder (Stage 7) + Entity Backfill (Stage 7b) complete
  - Reads `case_findings` + `kg_entities` + `kg_relationships` via SQL (not through LLM session state — fresh stage-isolated session)
  - Both data sources populated by earlier pipeline stages: findings from domain agents (Stage 6), KG from LLM KG Builder (Stage 7)
  - Stores all outputs via dedicated storage services
  - Triggers Geospatial Agent (Phase 8.1) if `has_location_data == True`
- SSE events:
  - `SYNTHESIS_STARTED`, `SYNTHESIS_COMPLETE`
  - `HYPOTHESIS_CREATED` (per hypothesis)
  - `CONTRADICTION_DETECTED` (per contradiction)
  - `GAP_IDENTIFIED` (per gap)
  - `TIMELINE_EVENT_CREATED` (per event)
- Synthesis API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/synthesis` — Full synthesis results (summary, verdict, conclusions)
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/hypotheses` — Hypotheses with evidence links
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/contradictions` — Contradictions with source pairs
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/gaps` — Evidence gaps with priorities
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/timeline/events` — Timeline events
- Frontend integration (connecting existing components to real data):
  - Hypothesis view → case_hypotheses API (cards with claim, status badge, confidence meter, evidence counts)
  - Contradictions panel → case_contradictions API (claim A vs claim B, severity, source navigation)
  - Evidence gaps panel → case_gaps API (description, priority, suggestions)
  - Timeline → timeline_events API (TimelineCore.tsx, TimelineEventCard.tsx connected to real events)
  - Case summary/verdict display (in case layout or dedicated component)
- Investigation task generation:
  - Tasks from contradictions (`resolve_contradiction`)
  - Tasks from gaps (`obtain_evidence`)
  - Tasks from pending hypotheses (`verify_hypothesis`)
  - Task deduplication via existing task list injection into synthesis prompt
  - Stored in investigation_tasks table

**Known Issues to Resolve (from `.planning/MINOR_ISSUES.md`):**
- ~~**MI-003**: Fuzzy entity deduplication~~ — **RESOLVED by Phase 7.1**: The programmatic KG Builder (with fuzzy dedup) was replaced by the LLM-based KG Builder Agent, which uses a clear-and-rebuild strategy with natural LLM deduplication. No fuzzy matching exists anymore.
- **MI-004**: Pipeline summary log mixes triage entity count + domain entity count as `entities=N`, confusingly alongside `kg_entities=M`. Fix: rename or separate the counters in `pipeline.py` for clarity.

**Technical Notes:**
- Synthesis Agent runs in fresh stage-isolated ADK session (consistent with existing pattern)
- Input is TEXT from PostgreSQL (case_findings + kg_entities + kg_relationships), NOT multimodal file content
- Synthesis reads the outputs of ALL agents that ran for this workflow: domain agent findings (financial, legal, evidence) + strategy findings are in case_findings; the curated entity/relationship graph from LLM KG Builder is in kg_entities/kg_relationships
- 1M context window handles even large cases comfortably (~100-150K tokens for 50-file case)
- Cost estimate: ~$0.10-0.15 per synthesis run at Gemini Pro rates
- Synthesis prompt: "Every contradiction must cite exact source excerpts from both sides"
- Hypothesis confidence: deterministic (sum(supporting_weights) / sum(all_weights)), user override allowed
- Timeline events are a natural byproduct of chronological cross-referencing (no separate timeline agent)
- Synthesis is a BATCH operation, runs once per analysis pipeline
- All synthesis outputs reference back to case_findings IDs and kg_entity IDs for traceability
- Full pipeline: Triage → Orchestrator → Domain Agents (parallel) → Strategy (sequential) → HITL → Save Findings → LLM KG Builder → Backfill Entity IDs → **Synthesis** → [Geospatial if locations] → Final
- `investigation_tasks` table does NOT exist yet — must be created in Phase 8 (new model + Alembic migration) if task generation is included, or deferred
- **Key files to create:**
  - `backend/app/agents/synthesis/` — Synthesis agent module (agent, prompts, schemas)
  - `backend/app/services/synthesis_service.py` — Storage service for synthesis outputs
  - `backend/app/api/synthesis.py` — Synthesis API endpoints
  - `backend/app/api/timeline.py` — Timeline API endpoints
  - `backend/app/api/hypotheses.py` — Hypothesis API endpoints

**Exit Criteria:**
- Synthesis Agent produces unified analysis from all domain findings
- Hypotheses generated with evidence links and confidence scores
- Contradictions detected with severity and exact source citations on both sides
- Evidence gaps identified with priority and actionable suggestions
- Timeline events populate the Timeline view with real data
- Cross-modal and cross-domain conclusions identified
- Case summary and verdict generated
- All results stored in appropriate tables and accessible via API
- SSE events signal data readiness for frontend
- Existing frontend components display real data (not mock)
- Investigation tasks generated from contradictions/gaps/hypotheses

**Deliverables:**
- Geospatial Agent implementation (LLM with tools):
  - **On-demand execution** (user-triggered from Geospatial tab, NOT auto-triggered)
  - Accesses synthesis outputs, domain findings, KG entities, timeline events from DB
  - Extracts location references (addresses, place names, coordinates)
  - Disambiguates ambiguous place names using context
  - Geocodes locations to coordinates via Google Maps Geocoding API
  - Detects movement patterns and temporal-spatial relationships
  - Categorizes locations by type (crime_scene, witness_location, evidence_location, suspect_location, other)
  - Associates events with locations (what happened where, when)
  - **Citation-based**: every location must have source file_id + page/timestamp + excerpt
  - Gemini 3 Pro with `thinking_level="medium"`
  - Inline Pro-to-Flash fallback
- Geocoding Service (`backend/app/services/geocoding_service.py`):
  - Google Maps Geocoding API integration
  - Address → coordinates resolution
  - Reverse geocoding for coordinate-only locations

- Locations API endpoints (`backend/app/api/locations.py`):
  - `POST /api/cases/:caseId/geospatial/generate` — Trigger geospatial analysis (on-demand)
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/geospatial/status` — Check if analysis exists + status
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/locations` — All locations with coordinates, types, events
  - `GET /api/cases/:caseId/locations/:locationId` — Location detail with citations
  - `DELETE /api/cases/:caseId/geospatial` — Clear geospatial data (for regeneration)

  - Hybrid storage: DB persistence + regeneration capability
- Movement pattern detection:
  - Connect locations showing movement over time (using timeline + temporal_associations)
  - GeospatialPath generation (from → to, with timestamps)
  - Route type classification (confirmed vs inferred based on evidence)
- Frontend enhancements (GeospatialMap component):
  - **"Generate Geospatial Intelligence" button** (triggers POST /geospatial/generate)
  - **Status indicator** (not generated / generating / complete)
  - **Refresh button** (regenerate analysis after new evidence added)
  - Replace mock data with real API data
  - Color-coded location markers by type
  - Movement paths visualization (solid for confirmed, dashed for inferred)
  - Click interactions → detailed intelligence panel
  - Intelligence panel shows: location name, type, events at location, citations, temporal associations
  - Basic filtering (by location type, date range)
- SSE events: `GEOSPATIAL_GENERATING`, `LOCATION_ENRICHED`, `GEOSPATIAL_COMPLETE`

**Technical Notes:**
- Geospatial Agent is an **on-demand** utility, triggered only when user requests it
- Storage is **hybrid**: results stored in DB (persistent), but can be regenerated
- Agent reads from: case_findings, case_synthesis, case_hypotheses, timeline_events, kg_entities, kg_relationships
- Google Maps API already integrated in frontend (GeospatialMap uses it)
- Map component already exists with Google Maps — replace mock data, add trigger UI

**Exit Criteria:**
- User can trigger geospatial analysis from Geospatial tab
- Locations extracted and geocoded from case data (synthesis + findings + KG + timeline)
- Locations stored in DB with citations (file_id, page/timestamp, excerpt)
- Movement patterns detected and stored as paths
- Map View displays real location data with color-coded markers
- Location markers clickable → detail panel with events, citations, temporal data
- Regeneration capability (user can refresh analysis)
- No auto-triggering (purely on-demand)

  - Each citation links to source file + exact location
  - Hover shows source preview
  - Click opens Source Panel (Phase 10)
- Context caching for cost optimization:
  - Context cache created when user opens case for chat
  - Cache includes case evidence file references
  - TTL: 2 hours (session duration)
  - Chat queries use `cached_content` parameter
- Context compaction for long sessions:
  - `EventsCompactionConfig` for Chat Agent sessions only (not pipeline)
  - Compaction interval: every 5 invocations
  - `LlmEventSummarizer` with Gemini Flash for cost efficiency
- Research/Discovery invocation:
  - Research Agent uses Gemini web search for source discovery
  - Discovery Agent synthesizes external research
  - Triggerable from chat ("Research background on [subject]")
  - Results feed back into case findings

**Technical Notes:**
- Chat Agent self-routes based on retrieval confidence — no separate router agent needed
- The LLM's native reasoning handles tool selection and escalation decisions
- System prompt loaded with case_synthesis.case_summary on each chat session start
- KG queries via SQL for sub-100ms fast path responses

Note: Phase 7.1 (KG Builder Agent) is a prerequisite for both Phase 7.2 (frontend) and Phase 8 (synthesis) — curated KG data is needed by both. Phase 7.2 and Phase 8 can run in parallel since they're independent (frontend vs backend). Phase 7.3 is deferred/optional — only if D3.js proves insufficient. Phase 8.1 runs after Phase 8 synthesis completes. Phase 9 depends on both Phase 7.1 (KG tables) and Phase 8 (synthesis tables).

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Phase |
|------|------------|-------|
| ADK production limitations | Fresh instances, state namespacing, test early, document limitations | 4 |
| ADK tool confirmation unavailable | Frontend confirmation dialogs (DatabaseSessionService limitation) | 7 |
| Tools + output_schema conflict | Split into tool-agent → schema-agent pipeline | 5, 6 |
| Thought signatures lost | Let SDK handle; preserve entire response metadata in storage | 4 |
| SSE fails in Cloud Run | Proper headers, heartbeat, polling fallback | 1, 7 |
| LLM hallucination | Multi-agent verification, span-level citations | 5, 6, 11 |
| Rate limiting | Tier upgrade budget, request queuing, context caching | 4, 5, 9 |
| Cloud Run timeout | Async processing, chunked responses | 3, 4, 5 |
| Entity resolution at scale | Incremental ER with blocking | 6 |
| React Flow performance | Memoization, virtualization | 7 |
| Context window exhaustion | Context compaction for long sessions | 9 |
| High Gemini costs | Context caching (4x cheaper), Flash fallbacks | 5, 9 |
| Dense document extraction | media_resolution="high" for legal documents | 5 |
| Video/audio precision | VideoMetadata with start/end offsets | 5 |
