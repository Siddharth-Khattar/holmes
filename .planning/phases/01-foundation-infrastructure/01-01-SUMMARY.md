requires:
  - phase: none
    provides: initial project

provides:
  - Bun workspace configuration with frontend and packages/* references
  - Python backend with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg dependencies
  - Makefile for cross-language orchestration
  - Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL 17
  - Lefthook git hooks for linting
  - @holmes/types package placeholder for generated TypeScript

affects:
  - 01-02 (CI/CD and Terraform)
  - 02-auth (Better Auth setup)
  - All future phases (monorepo foundation)

tech-stack:
  added:
    - bun (package manager)
    - uv (Python package manager)
    - lefthook (git hooks)
    - fastapi>=0.115.0

    - sse-starlette>=2.2.0
    - ruff>=0.8.6
  patterns:
    - Bun workspaces for monorepo
    - uv for Python dependency management
    - Makefile for cross-language commands
    - Pydantic Settings for configuration

key-files:
  created:
    - package.json
    - .env.example
    - backend/pyproject.toml
    - backend/app/config.py
    - Makefile
    - lefthook.yml
    - docker-compose.yml
    - packages/types/package.json
  modified:
    - .gitignore

key-decisions:
  - "Used pydantic-settings for environment configuration with comma-separated CORS parsing"
  - "Type generation now uses FastAPI OpenAPI -> openapi-typescript (no Python-based generator chain)"
  - "Added hatch.build.targets.wheel config for proper package structure"

patterns-established:
  - "HTTP contract as source of truth: FastAPI OpenAPI defines API schemas"
  - "Type generation: backend schemas -> packages/types/src/generated"
  - "Cross-language orchestration via Makefile"

# Phase 1 Plan 01: Monorepo Setup Summary

**Bun workspaces with uv Python backend, Makefile orchestration, Docker PostgreSQL, and Lefthook git hooks**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min 50 sec
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T02:33:45Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T02:38:35Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 13

## Accomplishments

- Created monorepo with Bun workspaces (frontend, packages/*)
- Set up Python backend with FastAPI and full async stack
- Configured development tooling (Makefile, Lefthook, Docker Compose)
- Established @holmes/types package for TypeScript type generation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create root workspace configuration** - `0abf59f` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create Python backend project structure** - `f90352a` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create development tooling and Docker setup** - `461c90a` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `package.json` - Bun workspace configuration with scripts
- `.gitignore` - Extended with Node.js, Terraform, environment patterns
- `.env.example` - Documented environment variable template
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Python project with FastAPI stack and Ruff
- `backend/.python-version` - Python 3.12
- `backend/app/__init__.py` - Application package
- `backend/app/config.py` - Pydantic Settings configuration
- `backend/uv.lock` - Locked Python dependencies
- `Makefile` - Cross-language orchestration targets
- `lefthook.yml` - Git hooks for ruff, eslint, prettier
- `docker-compose.yml` - PostgreSQL 17 local development
- `packages/types/package.json` - @holmes/types package
- `packages/types/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `packages/types/src/generated/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for generated types
- `frontend/package.json` - Placeholder frontend package
- `bun.lock` - Bun lockfile

## Decisions Made

1. **Type generation approach (current):** FastAPI OpenAPI -> openapi-typescript. (Legacy note: earlier plans mentioned a Python-based generator chain, but it is no longer used.)

2. **Added hatch build configuration:** Hatchling requires explicit package location. Added `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` with `packages = ["app"]`.

3. **Frontend placeholder:** Created minimal frontend/package.json to satisfy Bun workspace references. Will be replaced with actual Next.js app in later phase.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Legacy: Python typegen dependency version constraint**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Python backend setup)
- **Issue:** Plan referenced a Python-based typegen dependency version that did not exist on PyPI
- **Fix:** Adjusted version constraint to the available version (later superseded by OpenAPI -> openapi-typescript)
- **Files modified:** backend/pyproject.toml
- **Verification:** uv sync succeeds
- **Committed in:** f90352a (Task 2 commit)

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added hatch build configuration**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Python backend setup)
- **Issue:** Hatchling couldn't determine package location
- **Fix:** Added [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] with packages = ["app"]
- **Files modified:** backend/pyproject.toml
- **Verification:** uv sync succeeds
- **Committed in:** f90352a (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes were necessary for uv sync to succeed. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

- **Docker not available:** Could not verify `docker compose up -d` as Docker is not installed on this machine. The docker-compose.yml configuration is correct and will work when Docker is available.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. Local development can proceed once Docker is available for PostgreSQL.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Monorepo structure ready for CI/CD setup (01-02)
- Python backend ready for FastAPI main.py and API endpoints
- Types package ready for OpenAPI-to-TypeScript generation
- Frontend placeholder ready to be replaced with Next.js app

**Blockers:** None
**Concerns:** Docker availability for local PostgreSQL
