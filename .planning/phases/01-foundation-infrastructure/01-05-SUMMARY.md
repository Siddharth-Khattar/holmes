# Plan 01-05: Next.js Frontend Skeleton Summary

**Next.js 16.1 with Tailwind v4, Holmes branding, @holmes/types integration, and production Docker image**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T00:13:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T00:16:26Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (Tasks 1-2 pre-existing, Task 3 completed)
- **Files modified:** 1 (Dockerfile created)

## Accomplishments

- Verified existing Next.js 16.1 skeleton with App Router
- Verified Tailwind CSS 4.x with CSS-first configuration
- Verified Holmes home page with branding and auth placeholders
- Created production Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- Verified @holmes/types workspace integration working

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Initialize Next.js project** - `3811c27` (pre-existing, from earlier execution)
2. **Task 2: Create home page and API client** - `3811c27` (pre-existing, from earlier execution)
3. **Task 3: Create production Dockerfile** - `560f04a` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** pending

## Files Created/Modified

- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage production build for Cloud Run deployment
- `frontend/package.json` - Next.js 16.1.4 with @holmes/types workspace dependency
- `frontend/next.config.ts` - Standalone output configuration
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` - Strict TypeScript with bundler resolution
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with Inter font and metadata
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Home page with Holmes branding, type import verification
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Type-safe fetch wrapper with checkHealth function
- `frontend/.env.example` - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL configuration

## Decisions Made

- Used multi-stage Docker build with Bun for deps/build phases, Node.js slim for runtime
- Dockerfile accounts for monorepo structure where standalone output places server.js in `frontend/` subdirectory
- Static assets and public folder copied separately (not included in standalone output by default)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as specified. Tasks 1 and 2 were already implemented in a previous session.

## Issues Encountered

- Docker not available in execution environment - Dockerfile created but cannot be tested locally
- Verified build process works correctly via `bun run build` producing standalone output

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Frontend skeleton ready for Phase 2 authentication integration
- Docker image can be built from repo root: `docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile -t holmes-frontend .`
- Home page has auth button placeholders ready for Better Auth integration
