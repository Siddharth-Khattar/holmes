key-decisions:
  - "Used Motion Variants type for animation definitions"
  - "GlassCard uses glass-panel class from globals.css for styling"
  - "AnimatedSection supports configurable delay via variant composition"

patterns-established:
  - "Animation variants: Define in lib/animations.ts, import where needed"
  - "Component structure: Client components with 'use client' directive for Motion"
  - "Barrel exports: UI components exported from components/ui/index.ts"

# Phase 1.1 Plan 02: UI Primitives & Animation Utilities Summary

**Animation utilities library with 6 variants (fadeInUp, fadeIn, staggerContainer, scaleOnHover, slideInFromLeft, slideInFromRight), GlassCard component with hover effects, and AnimatedSection wrapper for scroll-triggered reveals**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Created shared animation utilities library with 6 reusable Motion variants
- Built GlassCard component with Liquid Glass styling and hover scale effect
- Implemented AnimatedSection wrapper for scroll-triggered fade-in-up animations
- Established component structure patterns for the landing page

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create animation utilities library** - `7ca3401` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create GlassCard component** - `281af72` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create AnimatedSection wrapper** - `d839f68` (feat)

## Files Created

- `frontend/src/lib/animations.ts` - Shared animation variants (fadeInUp, fadeIn, staggerContainer, scaleOnHover, slideInFromLeft, slideInFromRight)
- `frontend/src/components/ui/glass-card.tsx` - GlassCard component with Motion hover effects
- `frontend/src/components/ui/index.ts` - Barrel export for UI components
- `frontend/src/components/landing/animated-section.tsx` - AnimatedSection wrapper for scroll-triggered reveals

## Decisions Made

- **Variants type from Motion:** Used Motion's Variants type for proper TypeScript typing of animation definitions
- **glass-panel class usage:** GlassCard uses the glass-panel utility class from globals.css rather than inline styles for consistency
- **Delay via variant composition:** AnimatedSection supports configurable delay by composing a new variant from fadeInUp rather than using animate prop override

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Animation utilities ready for use in landing page sections
- GlassCard available for feature cards, pricing cards, and other content containers
- AnimatedSection ready to wrap any section for scroll-triggered reveals
- Component patterns established for consistent landing page development
