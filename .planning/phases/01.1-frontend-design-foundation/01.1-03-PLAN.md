<objective>
Build the above-the-fold landing page sections: Navigation, Hero, and Problem.

Purpose: These are the first things users see. The hero establishes the brand with the Sherlock taglines and parallax depth. The navigation provides wayfinding with glass styling. The problem section hooks users by addressing their pain points.

Output: Three polished sections that form the top of the landing page.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Navigation component</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/navigation.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the fixed navigation bar with Liquid Glass styling.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Logo (Holmes) left-aligned
    - Minimal nav links: Platform, Features, How It Works
    - CTA buttons: Login, Get Started

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive (needed for scroll-based opacity changes)
    - Fixed position at top with z-50
    - Use glass-nav class for glass effect (defined in globals.css)
    - Logo: "Holmes" in font-serif with taupe accent color
    - Nav links: text-smoke with hover:text-taupe transition
    - Login button: ghost style (transparent bg, smoke text, hover:bg-glass-light)
    - Get Started button: solid taupe bg, charcoal text, hover:brightness-110

    Optional enhancement: Use useScroll to increase glass opacity after scrolling past hero (background goes from transparent to glass-nav).

    Keep buttons as non-functional for now (onClick handlers can be empty or link to "#").

    Responsive: Hide nav links on mobile, show hamburger menu icon (implementation can be basic - just the icon, drawer can come later).

    - Navigation renders at top of page
    - Glass effect visible (backdrop blur)
    - Links and buttons are styled correctly
    - Fixed positioning works on scroll
  </verify>
  <done>Navigation component complete with glass styling and responsive layout.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Hero section with parallax</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the hero section with parallax scroll effect.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Primary tagline: "Deduce. Discover. Decide."
    - Secondary tagline (Sherlock quote): "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." — Sherlock Holmes
    - Embedded product demo video placeholder (auto-muted, looping)
    - Primary CTA button

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive
    - Import useScroll, useTransform from "motion/react"
    - Use useRef for the section element
    - Full viewport height (min-h-screen)
    - Parallax layers per CONTEXT.md:
      - Background gradient (charcoal to jet) moves slowest
      - Text content moves at medium speed
      - Optional decorative elements move fastest
    - Primary tagline: text-6xl md:text-7xl font-serif font-bold text-smoke
    - Secondary tagline: text-xl text-smoke/70 max-w-2xl italic, with attribution styled differently
    - Video placeholder: Use a div with aspect-video, bg-jet, rounded-xl, with play button overlay. Can add real video later.
    - CTA button: "Start Your Investigation" with taupe background

    Fade out content as user scrolls (opacity transform tied to scroll progress).

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Problem section</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/problem-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the problem section addressing user pain points.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Headline addressing core pain points
    - 3-4 problem statements: Evidence overload, AI black box, fragmented workflows, cross-modal blindness
    - Visual treatment: subtle, understated—text-focused with minimal iconography

    Implementation:
    - Can be Server Component with AnimatedSection wrapper, OR Client Component if more control needed
    - Section headline: "The Investigation Challenge" or similar (text-4xl font-serif text-smoke)
    - Four problem cards/items with:
      - Problem title (text-xl font-semibold text-smoke)
      - Problem description (text-smoke/70)
    - Layout: 2x2 grid on desktop, single column on mobile
    - Minimal icons optional (use simple SVG or lucide-react icons if desired)
    - Use stagger animation for cards (staggerContainer variant + AnimatedSection)

    Problem content:
    1. Evidence Overload - "Thousands of documents, videos, and audio files. Critical details buried in noise."
    2. AI Black Box - "AI tools give answers but hide their reasoning. How can you trust what you can't verify?"
    3. Fragmented Workflows - "Evidence in one tool, analysis in another, notes scattered everywhere."
    4. Cross-Modal Blindness - "A video timestamp that matches a document date. A voice that appears in multiple calls. Connections invisible to siloed tools."

    Styling: Simple text treatment, no heavy glass effects here per LANDING-INIT.md guidance (subtle, understated).
