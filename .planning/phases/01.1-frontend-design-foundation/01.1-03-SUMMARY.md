# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - useScroll and useTransform for parallax effects
    - Scroll-based opacity transitions for navigation
    - Client component wrappers for interactive sections

key-files:
  created:
    - frontend/src/components/landing/navigation.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/landing/hero.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/landing/problem-section.tsx
  modified:
    - frontend/src/app/page.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Used useScroll/useTransform from motion/react for hero parallax"
  - "Navigation opacity transitions based on scroll position"
  - "Problem section uses staggerContainer for sequential reveal"
  - "Video placeholder styled with play button overlay for future video integration"

patterns-established:
  - "Parallax: useScroll with container ref, useTransform for y-offset mapping"
  - "Scroll-reactive nav: opacity and blur increase as user scrolls past hero"
  - "Pain point grid: 2x2 desktop, stacked mobile with AnimatedSection wrappers"
