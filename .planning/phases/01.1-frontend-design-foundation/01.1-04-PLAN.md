<objective>
Build the middle landing page sections: Solution, How It Works workflow, and Feature Highlights.

Purpose: These sections demonstrate Holmes' value proposition. The solution section contrasts with the problems. The workflow diagram shows the pipeline. Feature highlights deep-dive into specific capabilities. This is where users decide if Holmes is worth exploring.

Output: Three interactive sections with glass cards and animated workflow diagram.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Solution section with glass cards</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/solution-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the solution section introducing Holmes as the answer to the problems.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Headline introducing Holmes as the answer
    - Key solution pillars: Unified case workspace, transparent agent decisions, source-linked citations, knowledge graph visualization
    - Layered card layout with Liquid Glass styling

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive
    - Import GlassCard from "@/components/ui"
    - Import staggerContainer, fadeInUp from "@/lib/animations"
    - Section headline: "Holmes: Your AI Investigation Partner" or similar
    - Subheadline: brief value proposition (1 sentence)
    - 4 solution cards using GlassCard component:
      1. Unified Case Workspace - "Every document, video, and audio file in one intelligent workspace. No more tab juggling."
      2. Transparent AI Reasoning - "See exactly how Holmes reaches its conclusions. Every step visible, every decision traceable."
      3. Source-Linked Citations - "Every insight links directly to its source. Click any finding to see the evidence."
      4. Knowledge Graph Visualization - "Entities, relationships, and patterns visualized. See the connections others miss."

    Layout: 2x2 grid with glass cards, gap-6
    Each card: icon (optional, simple SVG), title (text-xl font-semibold text-smoke), description (text-smoke/70)

    Use motion.div with staggerContainer variant for the grid, fadeInUp for each card.

    - Section renders with headline and 4 glass cards
    - GlassCard hover effects work
    - Staggered reveal animation on scroll
    - Responsive layout (2x2 on desktop, 1 column on mobile)

  <done>Solution section complete with glass card layout and staggered animations.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create How It Works workflow diagram</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/how-it-works.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the animated workflow diagram showing Holmes' pipeline.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Visual workflow: Upload → Triage → Domain Analysis → Synthesis → Knowledge Graph
    - Animated on scroll—nodes/connections reveal progressively
    - Brief descriptor per stage

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive
    - Import motion, useInView from "motion/react"
    - Use useRef and useInView to trigger animation when section enters view

    Workflow steps (5 nodes):
    1. Upload - "Drop your evidence files"
    2. Triage - "AI categorizes by domain"
    3. Analysis - "Domain experts extract insights"
    4. Synthesis - "Cross-reference and connect"
    5. Knowledge Graph - "Visualize relationships"

    Visual design per CONTEXT.md:
    - Nodes: circular, bg-glass-light, backdrop-blur, border border-smoke/10
    - Node numbers in taupe accent color
    - Connection lines: gradient from taupe to stone, animate scaleX from 0 to 1
    - Sequential reveal: each node appears 0.3s after previous, connection line animates after node

    Layout:
    - Desktop: horizontal row with lines connecting nodes
    - Mobile: vertical stack with lines going down

    Labels appear below/beside nodes with slight delay after node animation.

    Use spring animation for nodes (type: "spring", stiffness: 200).

  <verify>
    - 5 workflow nodes visible
    - Sequential animation triggers when section scrolls into view
    - Connection lines animate between nodes
    - Labels visible for each step
    - Animation only plays once (viewport: { once: true })

  <done>How It Works section complete with animated workflow diagram.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Feature Highlights section</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/feature-highlights.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the feature highlights section with deep-dive cards.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Agent Decision Graph (Trace Theater): Full AI transparency
    - Knowledge Graph: Entity/relationship visualization with toggleable layers
    - Cross-Modal Evidence Linking: Automatic connections across file types
    - Contradiction & Gap Detection: Proactive inconsistency surfacing
    - Cards or alternating left/right sections with subtle Liquid Glass containers

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive
    - Import GlassCard from "@/components/ui"
    - Import animation variants

    Feature content:
    1. Agent Decision Graph
       - Title: "Agent Decision Graph"
       - Subtitle: "Full AI Transparency"
       - Description: "Watch Holmes think. Every agent's reasoning process visualized in real-time. See which documents were analyzed, what patterns were found, and how conclusions were reached."

    2. Knowledge Graph
       - Title: "Knowledge Graph"
       - Subtitle: "See the Connections"
       - Description: "Entities and relationships mapped visually. Toggle between five layers: Evidence, Legal, Strategy, Temporal, and Hypothesis. Find connections invisible to linear document review."

    3. Cross-Modal Evidence Linking
       - Title: "Cross-Modal Linking"
       - Subtitle: "Automatic Connections"
       - Description: "A timestamp in a video matches a date in a contract. A voice appears across multiple recordings. Holmes surfaces these connections automatically."

    4. Contradiction & Gap Detection
       - Title: "Contradiction Detection"
       - Subtitle: "Proactive Inconsistency Surfacing"
       - Description: "When evidence conflicts, Holmes flags it. When evidence is missing, Holmes identifies the gap. No more surprises in the courtroom."

    Layout options (choose one):
    A) 2x2 grid similar to solution section
    B) Alternating left/right with larger cards (image area + text area)

    Recommend option A for consistency, with slightly more prominent cards (larger padding, maybe subtle border glow on hover).

    Use staggered reveal animation.
