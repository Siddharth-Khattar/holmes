# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.1-frontend-design-foundation-01
    provides: Design tokens, glass-panel styles, Fraunces font
  - phase: 01.1-frontend-design-foundation-02
    provides: Animation utilities (fadeInUp, staggerContainer), GlassCard component
provides:
  - Solution section with four glass cards showcasing Holmes value proposition
  - How It Works workflow diagram with sequential animation
  - Feature Highlights section with four capability cards
affects: [01.1-05, landing-page-completion, cta-section, footer]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - useInView for scroll-triggered sequential animations
    - Spring animations for workflow node reveals
    - Responsive layouts (horizontal desktop / vertical mobile)

key-files:
  created:
    - frontend/src/components/landing/solution-section.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/landing/how-it-works.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/landing/feature-highlights.tsx
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Used useInView with once:true for workflow animation trigger"
  - "Spring animation (stiffness: 200) for workflow node reveals"
  - "Gradient connection lines (taupe to stone) between workflow nodes"
  - "2x2 grid layout for both Solution and Feature sections for consistency"

patterns-established:
  - "Sequential animation: stagger delay (index * 0.3s) with connection lines animating after nodes"
  - "Responsive workflow: horizontal flex on desktop, vertical stack on mobile"
  - "Content sections: consistent structure with header + grid of glass cards"

# Phase 1.1 Plan 04: Core Content Sections Summary

**Solution section with four glass cards (workspace, transparency, citations, knowledge graph), animated workflow diagram with five sequential steps, and feature highlights showcasing Agent Decision Graph, Knowledge Graph, Cross-Modal Linking, and Contradiction Detection**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Built Solution section introducing Holmes as the answer to investigation challenges
- Displayed four solution pillars (Unified Workspace, Transparent AI, Source-Linked Citations, Knowledge Graph) in glass cards
- Created animated workflow diagram showing Holmes' five-step pipeline
- Implemented sequential node reveals with spring animations and gradient connection lines
- Built Feature Highlights section with four detailed capability cards
- Made workflow responsive: horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile
- Applied consistent staggered reveal animations across all sections

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Solution section with glass cards** - `6b53658` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create How It Works workflow diagram** - `144623b` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create Feature Highlights section** - `6ba19b8` (feat)

## Files Created

- `frontend/src/components/landing/solution-section.tsx` - Solution section with four GlassCard pillars, staggered reveal, icons for each pillar
- `frontend/src/components/landing/how-it-works.tsx` - Animated workflow diagram with 5 nodes (Upload, Triage, Analysis, Synthesis, Knowledge Graph), spring animations, gradient connection lines
- `frontend/src/components/landing/feature-highlights.tsx` - Feature cards for Agent Decision Graph, Knowledge Graph, Cross-Modal Linking, Contradiction Detection with title/subtitle/description

## Decisions Made

None - followed plan as specified. Implementation aligned with LANDING-INIT.md requirements and established patterns from prior plans.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed without issues.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Core content sections complete and ready for visual review
- Landing page middle sections now display Holmes' value proposition
- Workflow animation pattern available for reuse in other process visualizations
- Ready for Plan 05: CTA section and Footer to complete landing page
- All sections use consistent animation timing and glass styling
