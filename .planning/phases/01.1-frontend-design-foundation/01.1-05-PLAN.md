<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Trust section and Footer</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/trust-section.tsx, frontend/src/components/landing/footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the trust/differentiators section and minimal footer.

    **Trust Section** (trust-section.tsx):
    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Security/compliance signals (icons or badges)
    - Key differentiators: Not simple RAG, not a prompt wrapper, native multimodal processing
    - Brief, confident copy—no testimonials needed

    Implementation:
    - Can be Server Component with AnimatedSection wrapper
    - Section headline: "Built Different" or "Why Holmes"
    - Three differentiator items:
      1. "Not RAG" - "Holmes doesn't just retrieve and generate. It reasons across evidence, building understanding from the ground up."
      2. "Not a Prompt Wrapper" - "Purpose-built for legal investigation. Domain agents, entity taxonomy, and case-specific knowledge graphs."
      3. "Native Multimodal" - "PDFs, videos, audio, images—processed natively by Gemini 3. No separate transcription pipelines."
    - Security badges (optional): Simple SVG icons or text badges for "SOC 2" / "Enterprise Ready" / "Encrypted"
    - Layout: horizontal row of 3 items on desktop, stack on mobile
    - Minimal styling, text-focused as per "subtle, understated"

    **Footer** (footer.tsx):
    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Minimal: Logo, nav links, legal links, copyright

    Implementation:
    - Server Component (no client interactivity needed)
    - Dark background (bg-charcoal or slightly lighter bg-jet)
    - Holmes logo (text, same style as nav)
    - Nav links: Platform, Features, How It Works (anchor links or #)
    - Legal links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service (can be # for now)
    - Copyright: "2026 Holmes. All rights reserved."
    - Layout: flex with logo left, links center, legal right on desktop; stacked on mobile

    Add ABOUTME comments.

    - Trust section renders with 3 differentiators

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CTA section</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/landing/cta-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the final call-to-action section.

    Requirements from LANDING-INIT.md:
    - Repeat primary tagline
    - Strong call-to-action: "Start Your Investigation" or similar
    - Email capture or Get Started button

    Implementation:
    - "use client" directive (for potential form interactivity)
    - Centered layout with generous vertical padding (py-24 or more)
    - Background: subtle gradient or glass panel for visual distinction
    - Primary tagline: "Deduce. Discover. Decide." in large serif text
    - Subtext: "Ready to transform your investigation workflow?"
    - CTA options (implement one or both):
      A) Single prominent button: "Start Your Investigation" (taupe bg, large padding)
      B) Email capture: Input field + "Get Early Access" button

    Recommend option A for simplicity (single button). Auth is coming in Phase 2.

    Button should have:
    - Large padding (px-8 py-4)
    - Taupe background with hover effect
    - Subtle glow on hover (shadow-glow-taupe)
    - Scale animation on hover (motion whileHover)

    Add section border or gradient at top to separate from Feature Highlights.

    Add ABOUTME comments.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Assemble landing page</name>
  <files>frontend/src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace the current placeholder page.tsx with the full landing page assembly.

    Import all landing page components:
    - Navigation
    - Hero
    - ProblemSection
    - SolutionSection
    - HowItWorks
    - FeatureHighlights
    - TrustSection
    - CTASection
    - Footer

    Page structure:
    ```tsx
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <Navigation />
          <main>
            <Hero />
            <ProblemSection />
            <SolutionSection />
            <HowItWorks />
            <FeatureHighlights />
            <TrustSection />
            <CTASection />
          </main>
          <Footer />
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

    This is a Server Component that composes Client Components. No "use client" needed at page level.

    Remove the old placeholder content entirely.

    Keep the @holmes/types import and type check if it's being used elsewhere for verification, OR remove it if no longer needed (Phase 1 verification is complete).

    Update ABOUTME comments to reflect this is now the landing page.

  <what-built>Complete landing page with all 9 sections: Navigation, Hero, Problem, Solution, How It Works, Feature Highlights, Trust, CTA, and Footer. Includes Liquid Glass styling, Fraunces typography, scroll animations, parallax effects, and animated workflow diagram.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `cd frontend && bun run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
    2. Verify visual design:
       - Dark charcoal background throughout
       - Fraunces serif font for headings and body
       - Glass effect on navigation bar
       - Glass cards in Solution and Feature sections
    3. Verify hero section:
       - "Deduce. Discover. Decide." tagline prominent
       - Sherlock quote with attribution
       - Parallax effect when scrolling (background moves slower than text)
    4. Verify scroll animations:
       - Sections fade in as they enter viewport
       - Problem/Solution cards stagger in sequentially
       - Workflow diagram nodes appear one by one with connecting lines
    5. Verify responsive layout:
       - Resize browser to mobile width (375px)
       - Navigation adapts (links hidden, hamburger visible)
       - Grid layouts stack vertically
       - Text remains readable
    6. Check browser console for errors (should be clean)
