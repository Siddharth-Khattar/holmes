patterns-established:
  - "Fixed background + scrollable content pattern for depth effects"

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Removed security signals | Trust section more effective with just differentiators; badges felt cluttered |
| Hackathon attribution | Replaced legal links with project context; more appropriate for demo |
| GCS bucket for video | 96MB video too large for container; env var allows local dev fallback |
| Fixed background layer | EtherealShadow fixed with z-0, content scrolls above with z-10 for depth |
| Dynamic video import | `ssr: false` prevents Next.js hydration mismatch with video element |

## Deviations from Plan

| Planned | Actual | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Security badges in Trust | Removed entirely | Design decision - differentiators alone more impactful |
| Legal links in Footer | Hackathon attribution | More relevant for demo context |
| Simple page assembly | Extensive visual enhancements | Design polish iterations after initial assembly |

## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Video hydration mismatch | Used dynamic import with `ssr: false` |
| Logo scaling artifacts | Created pre-sized 2x PNG asset |
| 96MB video in container | Moved to GCS bucket with env var |

## User Setup Required

For local development with video:
1. Either use local fallback (`/video.mp4`) or
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIDEO_URL` in `.env.local` pointing to GCS bucket

## Phase 1.1 Complete

Phase 1.1 (Frontend Design Foundation) is now **COMPLETE**. All 5 plans executed:

| Plan | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 01.1-01 | Design tokens & typography | ✓ Complete |
| 01.1-02 | UI primitives & animation | ✓ Complete |
| 01.1-03 | Above-the-fold sections | ✓ Complete |
| 01.1-04 | Core content sections | ✓ Complete |
| 01.1-05 | Final sections & assembly | ✓ Complete |

**Landing page components created:** 13 total
- Navigation, Hero, Problem, Solution, How It Works, Feature Highlights, Trust, CTA, Footer
- Supporting: AnimatedSection, EtherealShadow, SectionDivider, GoogleGeminiEffect

**Design system established:**
- Premium cream color palette
- Liquid Glass effect system (cards, buttons, navigation)
- Fraunces serif typography
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Responsive layouts

## Next Phase Readiness

- Landing page complete and ready for production deploy
- Design system patterns available for reuse in authenticated views
- GlassCard, AnimatedSection, animation utilities ready for Phase 2 components
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Authentication & Case Shell
