# Phase 1.1: Frontend Design Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish the visual design system, Liquid Glass styling, and landing page that sets the aesthetic tone for the entire Holmes application. This includes design tokens, reusable component patterns, and the full landing page following DOCS/UI/LANDING-INIT.md specification.

## Implementation Decisions

### Liquid Glass intensity
- Subtle elegance — glass is felt more than seen, hint of translucency with minimal blur
- Apply glass styling to navigation bar and cards only (feature cards, solution cards)
- Scroll parallax — glass depth shifts as user scrolls, creating layered dimension
- Borderless glass panels — no visible borders, panels float with only blur defining edges

### Color palette & accents
- Charcoal depth background (#121218 range) with subtle blue undertone — tech sophistication
- Reference palette from brand direction:
  - Charcoal: #121218 (deepest darks, background base)
  - Jet Black: #22333B (cool teal-black, secondary accent)
  - White Smoke: #F2F4F3 (text, highlights)
  - Dusty Taupe: #A9927D (primary warm accent)
  - Stone Brown: #5E503F (supporting warm tone)
- Accent usage: threaded through — accent in headings, icons, borders for cohesive presence
- Dual accent approach: Taupe family as primary warmth + Jet Black teal as cool complement

### Typography character
- Elegant serif for headings — classic, authoritative, legal gravitas
- Matching serif for body text — full editorial feel throughout, very literary
- Medium contrast — semi-bold headings, regular body for balanced elegance
- Distinctive serif style preference — Fraunces, Newsreader, or similar character fonts that avoid generic AI aesthetics

### Animation philosophy
- Considered touches — thoughtful animations at interaction points, purposeful motion
- Scroll animations to make things feel alive throughout the page
- Parallax layers on scroll reveal — different elements move at different speeds for depth
- Workflow diagram: connection flow animation — lines animate between nodes showing data flowing through
- Hover interactions: subtle shift — slight scale or shadow change, responsive but quiet

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific serif font selection within the distinctive style direction
- Exact accent color balance between taupe and teal
- Animation timing and easing curves
- Specific blur values and opacity levels for glass effects
- Mobile-specific adaptations of effects

## Specific Ideas

- Detective noir meets modern AI aesthetic — the intersection of classic investigation and cutting-edge technology
- Reference palette provides warm/cool balance: taupe warmth grounds the noir, teal-black adds tech sophistication
- "Like Linear's issue cards — clean, not cluttered" applies to card styling
- Full editorial typography creates distinctive brand identity, avoids generic tech landing page feel
- Glass effects should enhance, not dominate — elegance over spectacle
