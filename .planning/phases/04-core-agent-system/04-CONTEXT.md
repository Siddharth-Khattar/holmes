# Phase 4: Core Agent System - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish Google ADK infrastructure and implement the first two agents: Triage Agent and Orchestrator Agent. This includes the agent factory pattern, state management, callback-to-SSE mapping, and the foundation for all subsequent agent work. Domain agents (Financial, Legal, Strategy, Evidence), Research/Discovery agents, and Synthesis are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Triage Behavior
- **Trigger:** Batch after uploads — user uploads files, then explicitly starts analysis for all files at once
- **Domain scoring:** Confidence percentages (0-100) per domain, enabling weighted routing
- **Entity extraction:** Basic entities only — names, organizations, dates, locations (domain agents do full extraction)
- **Summaries:** Both short (1-2 sentences for list view) and detailed (paragraph, available on expand)
- **Complexity assessment:** Simple tier (Low/Medium/High) per file for resource and specialist agent allocation
- **Contradiction/gap detection:** Leave to Synthesis Agent — Triage stays simple
- **File groupings:** Yes, suggest groupings (e.g., "these 3 files relate to same transaction") for Orchestrator batching
- **Corrupted files:** Partial extraction — extract whatever possible, mark confidence as low

### Orchestrator Routing
- **Agent invocation:** Hybrid — parallel for primary domains, sequential for edge cases
  - Orchestrator has freedom to determine where to sequentialize
  - Robust system prompt with tight guardrails to prevent unnecessary subagent spawning
  - Well-justified reasons allow spawning agents as needed
- **Domain threshold:** Dynamic — Orchestrator decides based on case complexity and file types
- **User confirmation:** No confirmation needed — fully autonomous routing
- **Research/Discovery triggers:** Autonomous — Orchestrator triggers research automatically when gaps detected
- **Routing log:** Yes, detailed reasoning — store and display why each routing decision was made
- **File groupings:** Pass groups to agents — domain agents receive file groups together for context
- **Concurrent limit:** No limit — spawn as many parallel agents as routing logic dictates
- **Mid-analysis uploads:** Queue new files — continue current analysis, new files wait for next batch

### Agent Lifecycle Events
- **Thinking trace granularity:** Batched (every few seconds) — aggregate thoughts, send periodically
- **SSE events:** Middle ground — SPAWNED, TOOL_CALLED, COMPLETED, ERROR
- **Token metrics:** Yes, per-agent usage — include input/output tokens for cost visibility
- **Progress indication:** Stage-based — show current stage (e.g., "Extracting entities")
- **Execution timing:** Yes, per-agent timing — track start/end time for each agent
- **Model display:** Yes, show model — display Flash vs Pro in Agent Flow for transparency
- **Execution logging:** Full execution log — store complete inputs, outputs, traces, timing (audit trail)
- **History replay:** No — Agent Flow shows live execution only, no history view

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- **Primary fallback:** Both (retry then fallback) — retry same model once, then try simpler model (Pro → Flash)
- **Retry count:** 1 retry before moving to fallback — quick fail to fallback for faster recovery
- **Error display:** Inline in Agent Flow — error appears on failed agent node with details
- **Parallel agent failure:** Continue others — graceful degradation, show partial results
- **Manual retry:** Yes, retry button — user can retry failed agent, results aggregated by Synthesis
- **Rate limiting (429):** Queue and notify — queue the request, notify user of delay
- **Partial results:** Save partial if no retry; discard and replace if retry succeeds (Last Write Wins)
- **Error details:** Technical details available — simple message by default, expandable for technical info

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific SSE event payload structure
- Internal state management implementation details
- Exact retry timing and backoff intervals
- Agent factory implementation pattern specifics
- Database schema for execution logging

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Orchestrator should have tight guardrails in system prompt but freedom to spawn agents when well-justified
- "Last Write Wins" for partial results — if retry succeeds, fresh results replace partial ones
- User sees per-agent token usage for cost transparency (important for understanding API costs)
- Stage-based progress is more honest than fake percentages
