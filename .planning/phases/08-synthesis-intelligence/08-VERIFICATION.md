# Phase 8: Synthesis Agent & Intelligence Layer Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Cross-reference all domain findings to generate hypotheses, contradictions, evidence gaps, timeline events, cross-modal/cross-domain conclusions, and case-level summary/verdict. Connect existing frontend components to real data.
**Verified:** 2026-02-09T02:00:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Synthesis Agent cross-references domain findings and KG data to produce all output types | VERIFIED | `backend/app/agents/synthesis.py` (665 lines): `assemble_synthesis_input()` queries 5 data sources (case, files, findings, entities, relationships); `write_synthesis_output()` writes to 6 tables + Case verdict columns. SynthesisOutput schema has all 12 fields. |
| 2 | Hypotheses generated with evidence links and confidence scores | VERIFIED | `SynthesisHypothesis` schema has claim, confidence (0-100), reasoning, evidence list with finding_id/role/excerpt. `write_synthesis_output` derives status from confidence (>60 SUPPORTED, <40 REFUTED, else PENDING), splits evidence by role, stores in `case_hypotheses`. |
| 3 | Contradictions detected with severity and exact source citations on both sides | VERIFIED | `SynthesisContradiction` schema has claim_a, claim_b, source_a_finding_id, source_a_excerpt, source_b_finding_id, source_b_excerpt, severity (minor/significant/critical), domain. Writer stores as JSONB `source_a`/`source_b` dicts with finding_id + excerpt. |
| 4 | Evidence gaps identified with priority and actionable suggestions | VERIFIED | `SynthesisGap` schema has description, what_is_missing, why_needed, priority, suggested_actions, related_entity_ids. All fields written to `case_gaps` table. |
| 5 | Timeline events populate the Timeline view with real data | VERIFIED | Backend: `timeline_events` table populated by `write_synthesis_output`. API: `GET /api/cases/:caseId/timeline` endpoint in `backend/app/api/timeline.py` (181 lines) with filtering (layers, dates, search) and aggregation. Frontend: `timelineApi.getTimelineEvents()` fetches real data with JWT auth and `transformBackendEvent()` maps backend fields (event_date->date, layer->layer). Mock fallback removed from `useTimelineData.ts`. |
| 6 | Case summary/verdict generated and displayed in UI | VERIFIED | Backend: `case_synthesis` table stores case_summary, case_verdict JSONB. `Case.verdict_label` and `Case.verdict_summary` updated. `CaseResponse` schema includes verdict fields. Frontend: `VerdictSummary.tsx` (169 lines) renders case_summary prose + verdict box with evidence strength badge (Conclusive/Substantial/Inconclusive), key strengths (green), key weaknesses (red). |
| 7 | Command Center has Agent Flow / Verdict tab toggle with SSE-driven activation | VERIFIED | `command-center/page.tsx` (247 lines): TABS array with "agent-flow" and "verdict", `synthesisAvailable` computed from SSE `sseReady` OR API data existence, disabled verdict tab with pulse indicator, URL search param persistence. SSE chain: `emit_synthesis_data_ready()` in pipeline -> `useCommandCenterSSE` -> `handleSynthesisDataReady` in `useAgentStates` -> `setSynthesisReady(true)` -> `synthesisReady` boolean -> tab activation. |
| 8 | Clicking hypothesis/contradiction/gap opens DetailSidebar with full details | VERIFIED | VerdictView constructs `SidebarContentDescriptor` objects with types "verdict-hypothesis", "verdict-contradiction", "verdict-gap". `detail-sidebar.tsx` renders `HypothesisDetailPanel` (272 lines, confidence meter + evidence list), `ContradictionDetailPanel` (211 lines, side-by-side claims + source excerpts), `GapDetailPanel` (183 lines, what_is_missing + suggested actions). |

**Score:** 8/8 truths verified

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none found) | - | - | - | - |

No TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER, or stub patterns found in any modified file. All `return null` and `return []` instances are appropriate guard clauses for empty/loading states, not stubs.

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Visual appearance of Verdict view

**Test:** Open a case that has completed analysis. Switch to the Verdict tab in Command Center.
**Expected:** Scrollable view with 6 sections (Summary & Verdict, Key Findings, Hypotheses, Contradictions, Evidence Gaps, Investigation Tasks). Each section has a heading with count badge. Cards are styled in the Holmes dark theme.
**Why human:** Visual layout, card styling, and scroll behavior cannot be verified programmatically.

### 2. Synthesis Agent LLM output quality

**Test:** Run a full analysis pipeline on a case with multiple uploaded documents.
**Expected:** The Synthesis Agent produces meaningful hypotheses (varied confidence scores), genuine contradictions (with correct severity), actionable gap suggestions, and chronologically ordered timeline events. Case verdict has one of the three strength labels.
**Why human:** LLM output quality requires human judgment. Structured output correctness (field presence/types) is verified programmatically, but content quality is not.

### 3. SSE-driven Verdict tab activation

**Test:** Open Command Center before analysis completes. Verify the Verdict tab is disabled with a pulse indicator. Start or wait for analysis. Verify the Verdict tab activates when synthesis completes without page refresh.
**Expected:** Tab transitions from disabled (greyed, pulsing dot) to enabled. Clicking it shows the VerdictView with data.
**Why human:** Real-time SSE behavior and visual state transitions cannot be verified programmatically.

### 4. Detail sidebar interaction chain

**Test:** In the Verdict tab, click a hypothesis card. Verify the DetailSidebar opens with the full hypothesis detail (confidence meter, evidence list). Click a contradiction card and verify side-by-side claims. Click a gap card and verify suggested actions.
**Expected:** Each card click opens the correct detail panel in the sidebar. Content matches the card clicked.
**Why human:** UI interaction flow and sidebar rendering require manual testing.

### 5. Case header and list verdict badges

**Test:** Navigate to the cases list page after a case has completed analysis. Verify verdict badge appears on the case card. Navigate into the case and verify the case header shows the verdict badge and summary subtitle.
**Expected:** Verdict badges (Conclusive=green, Substantial=amber, Inconclusive=gray) appear in both locations. Pre-analysis cases show "Pending Analysis" badge.
**Why human:** Badge rendering and color verification require visual inspection.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 8 observable truths are verified at all three levels (existence, substantive implementation, wired to the system). The phase delivers:

- **Backend:** Synthesis Agent (DomainAgentRunner subclass) reading 5 DB data sources, producing structured output with 12 fields, writing to 6 destination tables + Case verdict columns, integrated as pipeline Stage 8 with SSE events.
- **API:** 8 endpoints (6 synthesis + 2 timeline) with auth, ownership checks, filtering, and aggregation.
- **Frontend data layer:** TypeScript types, API client, React Query hooks matching all backend schemas.
- **Frontend UI:** 10 verdict components (7 cards/views + 3 detail panels) wired to real API data, Command Center tab toggle with SSE-driven activation, verdict badges in case header and list.
- **Timeline:** Real data from synthesis, mock fallback removed, financial layer added, field mapping in place.
- **Investigation tasks:** Full DB model, API endpoint, TaskCard component.

All key wiring connections verified: pipeline -> agent -> DB -> API -> frontend hooks -> UI components -> detail sidebar. No orphaned files or broken links.
