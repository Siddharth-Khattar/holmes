## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build. Common mistakes in this domain.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Autonomous Filing/Submission** | AI generating and filing legal documents without attorney review = malpractice risk | Always require attorney approval before any external action |
| **Definitive Legal Conclusions** | AI stating "you will win" or "this is illegal" = unauthorized practice of law | Provide analysis and evidence; let attorneys draw conclusions |
| **Hidden AI Reasoning** | Black box AI is unacceptable for legal work; courts require justification | Always show reasoning chain and source citations (Holmes core value) |
| **Training on Client Data by Default** | Client confidentiality is sacrosanct; training on one client's data exposes to others | Explicit opt-in only; clear data isolation; most firms will refuse |
| **Overly Complex Onboarding** | Legal professionals are time-pressed; if setup takes weeks, they won't use it | Simple drag-and-drop ingestion; progressive disclosure of advanced features |
| **Feature Bloat Before Core Value** | "Cobbling together legacy tools" pattern; doing many things poorly | Nail document processing + search + AI transparency first; expand from solid foundation |
| **Mock/Fake Case Citations** | Hallucinated case law (Mata v. Avianca disaster) destroys credibility | RAG with verified legal databases only; explicit "not found" when uncertain |
| **Fully Autonomous Document Review** | "AI completed your review" = no defensibility | AI assists and accelerates; human makes final coding decisions |
| **Scope Creep into Practice Management** | Different product category; dilutes focus | Stay focused on intelligence/investigation; integrate with practice management tools |
| **Per-Document Pricing** | Unpredictable costs make budgeting impossible; firms hate it | Predictable subscription pricing; Logikcull's unlimited model popular |
| **Desktop-Only or On-Premise Only** | Cloud is expected; on-prem is legacy overhead | Cloud-native with optional on-prem for regulated industries |
| **Ignoring Mobile** | Attorneys review on tablets; mobile access expected | Responsive design at minimum; native apps for heavy users |

**Key Insight:** Gemini 3's native multimodal capability eliminates traditional pipelines:
- No separate OCR → Gemini reads scanned docs directly
- No separate transcription → Gemini processes audio natively
- No separate video frame extraction → Gemini analyzes video directly
- Cross-modal linking happens naturally within domain context

## MVP Recommendation

For MVP, prioritize based on Holmes's core value proposition: **Transparent multimodal intelligence**.

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Table Stakes)
1. **File Storage & Ingestion** - Store PDF, DOCX, images, video, audio in GCS
2. **Gemini Multimodal Processing** - Gemini 3 directly analyzes all file types (no separate OCR/extraction)
3. **Full-Text Search** - Index Gemini's extracted content for search
4. **Source Citations** - Every AI output linked to source document + location
5. **Basic Security** - Auth, access controls, audit logging

**Rationale:** Gemini handles multimodal natively — no need for separate text extraction/OCR pipelines. This dramatically simplifies Phase 1.

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (First Differentiator)
1. **Domain Agents** - Financial, Legal, Strategy, Evidence agents with Gemini 3 Pro
2. **Entity Extraction** - People, organizations, dates, amounts
3. **Knowledge Graph** - Visualize relationships
4. **AI Reasoning Traces (Agent Trace Theater)** - Holmes's unique differentiator
5. **Natural Language Querying** - Ask questions of corpus

**Rationale:** Domain agents receive multimodal files directly — no preprocessing needed. Evidence Agent evaluates authenticity and chain of custody — critical for legal. Transparency + knowledge graph is unique combination.

### Phase 3: Cross-Modal Intelligence (Full Differentiator)
1. **Cross-Modal Evidence Linking** - Gemini sees all modalities together (not post-hoc stitching)
2. **Contradiction Detection** - Flag inconsistencies across sources
3. **Evidence Gap Identification** - What's missing?
4. **Synthesis Agent** - Cross-reference all domain findings
5. **Hypothesis System** - Track and evaluate investigation hypotheses
6. **Investigation Tasks** - Agent-generated actionable tasks from gaps/contradictions

**Rationale:** Full multimodal intelligence. Because Gemini processes all modalities natively, cross-modal linking happens naturally within domain context. Hypothesis-driven investigation adds structured investigation methodology.

### Phase 4: Extended Intelligence (Post-MVP Differentiators)
1. **Geospatial Intelligence** - Location extraction, Earth Engine satellite imagery, movement patterns
2. **Research/Discovery Agents** - External source discovery via Gemini web search
3. **Deep Research Integration** - Background autonomous research on subjects

**Rationale:** These features extend intelligence beyond uploaded evidence to external sources and geospatial verification.

### Defer to Post-MVP
- **Custom Workflow Builder**: Enterprise feature; adds complexity
- **Third-Party Integrations (Slack, M365)**: Nice-to-have, not core
- **Multi-Language Support**: Important but can add after core works
- **Legal Hold Management**: Essential for e-discovery but not for initial investigation use case
- **Production/Export**: Needed eventually but not for early exploration phase

## Complexity Assessment Summary

| Complexity | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **Low** | Metadata extraction, deduplication, OCR, audit trail |
| **Medium** | Full-text search, document summarization, video transcription, PII detection, timeline visualization |
| **High** | Knowledge graph, natural language querying, AI reasoning traces, predictive coding, domain-specialized agents |
| **Very High** | Cross-modal evidence linking, contradiction detection (cross-document), real-time collaboration at scale |
